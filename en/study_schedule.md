# Gaokao High-Intensity Study Plan (4 Months / Target 550)

## I. Strategy for Target 550
To reach 550 (assuming a total of 750), we prioritize the subjects with the highest return on investment (ROI):
1. **Math (120+)**: Focus on "Big Questions" types and fundamental theorems. See `Math/`.
2. **English (135+)**: High score is achievable with vocabulary saturation and fixed grammar patterns. See `English/`.
3. **Chinese (110+)**: Focus on classical text patterns and logic of argumentative essays. See `Chinese/`.
4. **Science Subjects (185+)**: Total score for Physics/Chemistry/Biology. Prioritize high-frequency concepts. See `Physics/`, `Chemistry/`, `Biology/`.

## II. The 4-Month Timeline

### Month 1: Foundation Reconstruction (Weeks 1-4)
- **Focus**: Clear all logical blind spots in textbooks.
- **Goal**: Reach 400-450 baseline.
- **Action**: 
  - Complete 1 round of core vocabulary (3500 words).
  - Solve all textbook example problems for Math.
  - Review fundamental laws for Science subjects.

### Month 2: Module-Based Attack (Weeks 5-8)
- **Focus**: Master specific question patterns (Topic-by-topic).
- **Goal**: Reach 480-500.
- **Action**:
  - Deep-dive into Math (Conic sections, sequences).
  - English: Cloze test and Reading comprehension drills.
  - Science: Systematic problem sets for mechanics/electromagnetism.

### Month 3: Past Paper Saturation (Weeks 9-12)
- **Focus**: Mimicking exam conditions and timing.
- **Goal**: Peak at 530+ in mocks.
- **Action**:
  - 1 Mock Exam every 3 days.
  - Mistake Log analysis (2 hours per day).
  - Speed training (e.g., 40 mins for English reading section).

### Month 4: Final Precision Buffing (Weeks 13-16)
- **Focus**: Mental state, exam skills, and "The Last 20 Points."
- **Goal**: Solidify 550.
- **Action**:
  - Review Mistake Logs daily.
  - Half-day mocks to maintain "biological rhythm" of exams.
  - Memorize essay templates for Chinese and English.

## IV. Subject Directory Usage
- `en/English/`: Vocab lists, grammar templates.
- `en/Math/`: Formula sheets, derivative/conic section cheat sheets.
- `en/Physics/`: Energy-momentum conservation logic.
- `en/Chemistry/`: Inorganic reactions, organic structural groups.
- `en/Biology/`: Cell cycles, inheritance calculations.
- `en/Chinese/`: Poetry analysis patterns, argumentative essay prompts.
- Reduce workload and increase rest if performance or health declines.
