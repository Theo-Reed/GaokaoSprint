# English Subject Strategy (Target 135)

## Core Parameters
- **Target Score**: 135/150
- **Exam Paper**: National Paper II (全国卷 II)
- **Status**: **No Listening Required**
  - *Reasoning*: Due to regional education resource disparities, listening is not included in the graduation requirement or specific provincial calculation in this track.
  - *Strategic Impact*: All cognitive energy is redirected to the written sections. 135/150 requires near-perfect accuracy in objective questions.

## Score Breakdown (Targeting ~90% accuracy)
1. **Reading Comprehension**: Goal is 0-1 error. Deep focus on logic inference.
2. **Cloze Test**: Goal is ≤ 2 errors. Master high-frequency collocations.
3. **Grammar Filler**: Goal is 100% accuracy. Zero tolerance for syntax errors.
4. **Writing (Composition)**: Goal is 23+/25. Focus on advanced sentence structures and handwriting legibility.

## Key Tactics
- **Vocabulary Multiplier**: Reach 4000+ words to ensure comfort in complex reading passages.
- **Logic Triggers**: Identity transition words (however, nonetheless, regardless) that signal answer shifts.
- **AI-Driven Grading**: Submit daily writing to AI for rubric-based scoring and syntax polishing.

## 4-Month Roadmap
- **Week 1-4**: Core Grammar & Vocabulary Saturation.
- **Week 5-8**: Section-specific tactics for Reading and Cloze.
- **Week 9-12**: Full-paper simulation (Blank papers only).
- **Week 13-16**: Refining writing templates and cleaning up logical fallacies in errors.
