I would choose "Fun at my school" as it demonstrates our vibrant campus life more comprehensively.

This column proves indispensable for several compelling reasons. First, showcasing diverse school activities like sports competitions and cultural festivals will strengthen our sense of belonging while attracting more readers who share similar experiences. Additionally, featuring students' profound moments during club activities or academic achievements creates authentic connections that resonate deeply with our audience. Most importantly, highlighting the fun aspects of school life encourages positive attitudes toward learning, making education more engaging and memorable for everyone involved.

Through sharing these joyful experiences, we can build a stronger school community where every student feels valued and inspired to contribute their own stories.
