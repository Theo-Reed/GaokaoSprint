Topic: 假定你是李华，你班的英语报要增设一个栏目。外教 Jenny 提出“Fun at my school”和“Guess who I am”两个选项供大家选择。请给Jenny写一封邮件，内容包括：
(1)你的选择；
(2)说明理由。
------------------------------
Weighing the two options, I strongly recommend "Fun at my school," which serves as an indispensable window into our vibrant campus life.

Ranging from sports meets to art festivals, this column enables us to share specific joyful moments, effectively strengthening our sense of belonging. Furthermore, describing these memorable experiences offers a profound opportunity to demonstrate our English proficiency in a creative context.

It is this engaging section that will undoubtedly foster a consistent passion for English learning while bringing us much closer together.
