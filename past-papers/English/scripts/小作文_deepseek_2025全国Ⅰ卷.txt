Dear Jenny,
I really like the idea of adding a new column to our English newspaper. It is "Fun at my school" that has captured my interest.

This column can vividly showcase our school's vibrant culture through specific events like art festivals. Furthermore, it fosters English usage by encouraging everyone to share their unique experiences, thus strengthening our language skills consistently.

I believe this engaging column will undoubtedly demonstrate the profound joy of our campus life.
