# 4-Month Gaokao Study Plan (From Zero to Target 550)

## Overview
- Duration: 4 months (approx. 16 weeks)
- Daily study window: 08:00–22:00 (14 hours) on weekdays; weekends for rest/light review.
- Goal: Build fundamentals, progress to past-paper training and targeted drills, reach total score ~550.

## Phase Goals
- Month 1 (Weeks 1–4): Foundations — core concepts in Chinese, Math, English; basic vocab and common problem types.
- Month 2 (Weeks 5–8): Expansion — fill gaps in science/social subjects, improve speed and solution structure.
- Month 3 (Weeks 9–12): Past-paper practice — frequent real exam papers and full mock exams; maintain a mistake log.
- Month 4 (Weeks 13–16): Final sprint — timed mock exams, exam skills, mental and physical conditioning, last weak-point fixes.

## Weekly Rhythm (example)
- Mon–Fri: follow daily template below.
- Sat–Sun: rest and recovery; 30–60 minutes active review each day; full mock every two weeks.

## Daily Template (Mon–Fri, 08:00–22:00)
- 08:00–08:30 — Morning routine, breakfast, plan for the day.
- 08:30–10:30 — Study block 1 (2.0 h): primary subject deep work (e.g., Math theory & problem practice).
- 10:30–10:45 — Short break (15 min).
- 10:45–12:15 — Study block 2 (1.5 h): Chinese reading or English grammar/vocab practice.
- 12:15–13:15 — Lunch and short rest (20–30 min nap optional).
- 13:15–15:15 — Study block 3 (2.0 h): science subject focus (Physics/Chemistry/Biology).
- 15:15–15:30 — Short break (15 min).
- 15:30–17:00 — Study block 4 (1.5 h): humanities or weaker-subject focus (History/Politics/Geography).
- 17:00–17:30 — Physical exercise (30 min; run or HIIT).
- 17:30–18:00 — Shower and relax.
- 18:00–19:00 — Dinner.
- 19:00–21:00 — Evening study (2.0 h): practice & mistake review / homework.
- 21:00–22:00 — Review and memory consolidation (1.0 h): review mistakes, plan next day, short spaced-repetition.

## Subject Rotation (weekly sample)
- Mon: Math (morning), Chinese (late morning), Physics (afternoon)
- Tue: Math, English, Chemistry
- Wed: Chinese, Physics/History mix, English listening/writing
- Thu: Math problem types, humanities topics, lab/experiment questions
- Fri: Half-day mock or timed practice + analysis

## Methods & Tools
- Use time-blocking (Pomodoro or 50/10) during deep study blocks.
- Maintain a mistake log organized by chapter and problem type; review weekly.
- Full mock exam every two weeks, graded strictly.

## Rest & Mental Health
- Aim for 7–8 hours nightly sleep. If ending study at 22:00, be in bed before 23:00.
- Use weekends for hobbies/outdoor activity to avoid burnout.

## Personalization
- Start broad to cover major topics; reprioritize weak areas after each bi-weekly mock.
- Reduce workload and increase rest if performance or health declines.
