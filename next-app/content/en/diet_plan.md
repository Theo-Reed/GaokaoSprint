# Diet Plan

## 1. Total Daily Targets
Based on a **178cm, 65kg Male** profile and a 14-hour high-intensity cognitive workload, the brain requires high energy turnover. The following targets are set to maintain body weight and supply ATP for sustained neural activity:

- Calories: 2550–2650 kcal
- Protein: 100–110 g (about $1.6\text{ g/kg}$) — supports neurotransmitter synthesis and prevents muscle loss from prolonged sitting.
- Carbohydrates: 390–420 g — the primary energy source for the brain; prioritize low-GI sources such as boiled potatoes, oats, and brown rice.
- Fats: 70–80 g — supports hormonal balance and neuronal membrane integrity; favor unsaturated fats.
- Water: 3000–3500 ml — note that ~2% dehydration can reduce logical reasoning performance by roughly 20%.

## 2. Per-Meal Targets
To keep cognition online from 08:00–22:00, use a 3-meal + 2-snack pattern to avoid blood-glucose troughs.

1. Breakfast (08:00) — "Engine Start"

- Energy: ~650 kcal
- Targets: Protein 25 g | Carbs 95 g | Fats 18 g
- Note: Include 5 g creatine. Morning insulin sensitivity helps shuttle creatine and glucose to support brain energy metabolism.

2. Lunch (11:30) — "Logical Foundation"

- Energy: ~800 kcal
- Targets: Protein 35 g | Carbs 120 g | Fats 20 g
- Note: This is the day’s largest carbohydrate load to ensure glycogen availability for afternoon STEM training (physics/math).

3. Afternoon Snack (15:30) — "Neural Rescue"

- Energy: ~250 kcal
- Targets: Protein 10 g | Carbs 45 g | Fats 5 g
- Note: Prevent the ~16:00 "brain fog" dip. A banana or small portion of oats works well for a quick glucose boost.

4. Dinner (18:30) — "Repair & Consolidation"

- Energy: ~700 kcal
- Targets: Protein 25 g | Carbs 100 g | Fats 20 g
- Note: Increase dark leafy vegetables. Take a B-complex multivitamin after dinner to support nocturnal memory consolidation.

5. Pre-Sleep Snack (21:30) — "Deep Sleep Guide"

- Energy: ~250 kcal
- Targets: Protein 10 g | Carbs 45 g | Fats 5 g
- Note: Include tryptophan-rich foods (e.g., warm milk or a boiled egg) to assist melatonin synthesis and promote high-quality deep sleep.

## 3. Reference Portions for Low-Cost Staples
Quick estimates to help assemble meals from inexpensive ingredients:

- 1 large boiled potato (250 g): ~200 kcal | Carbs 45 g | Protein 5 g
- 1 large boiled egg (60 g): ~80 kcal | Protein 7 g | Fat 5.5 g
- 1 can tuna in water (100 g): ~100 kcal | Protein 23 g | Fat 1 g
- 100 g frozen chicken breast: ~110 kcal | Protein 24 g | Fat 2 g
- 1 banana: ~100 kcal | Carbs 25 g

- 1 banana: ~100 kcal | Carbs 25 g

## Supplements (optional; consult a doctor)
Suggested timing aligns supplements with study load and circadian metabolism. Consult a physician before starting.

- 08:00 (Breakfast) — Creatine (5 g) + B-complex: activates energy metabolism and helps pre-stock brain energy.
- 12:00 (Lunch) — Lutein: protects vision and helps cope with the afternoon visual load.
- 15:00 (Afternoon snack) — Taurine: targeted at the day's most severe fatigue node.
- 18:30 (Dinner) — Deep-sea fish oil (Omega-3): supports neural repair and synaptic health.
- 21:30 (Pre-sleep) — Magnesium: reduces stress and promotes relaxation and high-quality deep sleep.
