# Environment

1. Air quality — CO₂ monitoring (highest priority)

### Risk
In closed rooms CO₂ can rise quickly; >1000 ppm impairs cognition, and ~1500 ppm causes drowsiness, slowed decisions, and headache.

### Target
Keep CO₂ < 1000 ppm where possible.

### Actions
Ventilate 10 minutes every 2 hours; use a CO₂ meter if available and ventilate when readings exceed 1000 ppm; practice deep diaphragmatic breathing as an immediate countermeasure.

2. Temperature — "Cool head, warm feet"

### Target
18–22°C (AC ≈ 22°C if needed).

### Rationale
Temperatures >24°C can induce peripheral vasodilation, reducing cerebral perfusion and increasing sleepiness.

### Actions
Keep head/face air cool and ventilated; keep feet warm (socks) to preserve comfort without overheating.

3. Lighting — circadian-aligned setup

### Daytime (08:00–17:00)
5000–6500K, desk illuminance 500–750 Lux to support alertness and analytical work.

### Evening (18:00–22:00)
3000–4000K to reduce blue light and prepare for sleep.

### Anti-glare
Place light front-side/side; avoid direct reflections. Match ambient/backlight brightness to your Mac M1 Pro screen.

4. Ergonomics — 90-90-90 principle

### Posture
Elbows, hips, knees ≈ 90°.

### Screen
Top edge at eye level — elevate M1 Pro with a stand or books.

### Workspace
Keep the desk minimal to minimize peripheral distraction.

5. Acoustic environment — steady masking noise

### Masking
Use pink or brown noise to mask sudden sounds and stabilize background auditory input.

### Prohibition
Avoid music with lyrics while studying; lyrics engage language centers and disrupt reading/listening.

6. Cold-water stimulation — acute alerting tool

### Mechanisms
Facial cold elevates norepinephrine, can trigger the mammalian dive reflex (prioritizes brain blood flow), and causes vasoconstriction that reduces facial puffiness.

### Practical guidance
10–30s splash to the face or a 30–60s cool shower for rapid alerting. Avoid prolonged cold exposure; consult a physician for cardiovascular concerns.
