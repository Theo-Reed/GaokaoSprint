# GaokaoSprint - Cockpit Dashboard

This dashboard monitors the core strategies and status of the GaokaoSprint system.

## Module Navigation

### 1. [Study Schedule](./study_schedule)
- **Objective**: Zero to 550 total score within 16 weeks.
- **Key Features**: 
  - 4-Phase Progression: Foundations, Module Attack, Mock Saturation, and Final Polishing.
  - 14-hour daily timeline designed for high-intensity cognitive output.

### 2. [Diet & Nutrition](./diet_plan)
- **Objective**: Sustain ATP production for 14 hours of logic-intensive work.
- **Key Features**: 
  - 2400-2500 kcal target with a 3+2 meal distribution.
  - Precise Supplement Schedule: Creatine for brain metabolism, B-complex for neural waste clearing, Taurine for caffeine synergy.
  - Focus on glycemic index (GI) control to prevent "food coma."

### 3. [Environment Hacks (environment.md)](./environment.md)
- **Objective**: Maintaining peak systemic arousal via physical variables.
- **Key Features**:
  - Air Quality: CO2 monitoring thresholds and ventilation protocols.
  - Circadian Lighting: 500-750 Lux targets and M1 Pro brightness matching.
  - Ergonomics: The 90-90-90 posture rule to minimize physical fatigue.

### 4. [Fatigue Intervention (fatigue_intervention.md)](./fatigue_intervention.md)
- **Objective**: Real-time management of cognitive burnout and drowsiness.
- **Key Features**:
  - 3-Tier Response Model: Seconds-level hacks (CO2 purge), Minutes-level recovery (NSDR), and Systemic prevention.
  - **AI Circuit-Breaker**: A protocol to detect synaptic saturation and force strategic downtime.
