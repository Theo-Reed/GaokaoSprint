# Gaokao Physics Scoring Strategy

## Stage 1: Must-Have "Base Points" (Estimated 25-30 points)
**Characteristics:** Single knowledge point, direct logic, extremely hard to lose points once understood.

| Knowledge Point | Question Type | Core Scoring Points | Suggested Points |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Atomic/Nuclear Physics | Multiple Choice | Photoelectric equation, energy level transitions ($h\nu = E_m - E_n$), nuclear decay equations. | 6 pts |
| Geometric/Physical Optics | MCQ/Fill-in | Law of refraction ($n = \sin i / \sin r$), total internal reflection, double-slit interference formula. | 6 pts |
| Mechanical Vibration & Waves | Multiple Choice | Conversion between wave and vibration graphs ($v = \lambda f$), mastering the "uphill/downhill" method. | 6 pts |
| Thermal Physics (Elective) | MCQ/Calculation | Ideal gas law $\frac{PV}{T} = C$, First Law of Thermodynamics $\Delta U = Q + W$. | 10-15 pts |

## Stage 2: High-Return "Routine Points" (Estimated 25-30 points)
**Characteristics:** Problems look difficult, but the physical processes are very fixed, suitable for students with high intelligence to model quickly.

| Knowledge Point | Question Type | Core Models & Secondary Conclusions | Suggested Points |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Gravitation & Spaceflight | Multiple Choice | Golden substitution: $GM = gR^2$; Basic idea: Gravity provides centripetal force (memorize "high-low speed-large" rule). | 6 pts |
| Electrostatic Field | Multiple Choice | Equipotential surfaces & field line distribution; relationship between potential energy & work; projectile motion of charged particles in electric fields. | 6 pts |
| Magnetic Field (Circular) | MCQ/First parts of FRQ | Find center, determine radius, fix central angle. Remember $R = \frac{mv}{qB}$, use geometry (Pythagorean theorem, trigonometry). | 6-10 pts |
| Mechanics Experiments | Experiment | Speed and acceleration using ticker timers (successive difference method); controlled variable analysis. | 6 pts |

## Stage 3: "Process Points" from Tough Problems (Estimated 15-20 points)
**Characteristics:** These are the final "pressure" problems; hard to get full marks with zero base, but with good understanding, you can grab 60% of points through "equation stacking".

| Knowledge Point | Question Type | Scoring Strategy | Estimated Points |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Momentum & Energy | FRQ/Pressure Prob | No matter how hard, write the big three: Kinetic Energy Theorem, Conservation of Momentum, Conservation of Energy. | 6-8 pts |
| Electromagnetic Induction | Calculation FRQ | Four steps: 1. Find EMF $E=BLv$; 2. Find Current $I=E/R$; 3. Find Ampere Force $F=BIL$; 4. List equations based on Newton's laws or energy. | 6-10 pts |
| Electrical Experiments | Experiment | Remember two methods for measuring resistance (internal/external connection); Voltammetry for EMF and internal resistance ($U-I$ graph). | 8-10 pts |
