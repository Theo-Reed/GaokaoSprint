# Gaokao Biology Memorization Strategy Guide

## Phase 1: Mastering the "Big Question Engine" (Highest points, ~45-50 pts)
**Goal:** Master core questions in *Selective Compulsory 1* and *Compulsory 1*. This is the minimum requirement for passing.

### 1. Priority #1: Selective Compulsory 1 "Homeostasis and Regulation"
*   **Essential Chapters:** Chapters 2, 3, and 4 (Nervous, Humoral, and Immune Regulation).
*   **Core Concepts:**
    *   **Nervous:** Mechanism of Resting/Action Potential (Na+/K+ flow), Unidirectional Nature of Synaptic Transmission.
    *   **Humoral:** Blood Glucose Regulation Model (Insulin and Glucagon), Feedback Regulation, Hierarchical Regulation Maps.
    *   **Immune:** Detailed Flowcharts of Humoral and Cellular Immunity (Memories of "Cytokines" are essential as per the new curriculum).
*   **Requirement:** Reproduce all flowcharts from the textbook on blank paper from memory.

### 2. Priority #2: Compulsory 1 "Chapter 5: Energy Supply and Utilization"
*   **Essential Chapters:** Section 3 (Respiration), Section 4 (Photosynthesis).
*   **Core Concepts:**
    *   **Respiration:** Locations, material changes, and energy changes of the three stages.
    *   **Photosynthesis:** Link between light and dark reactions, instantaneous changes in $C_3$ and $C_5$ levels.
*   **Requirement:** Memorize the experimental conclusions and long-form descriptions for **"Investigating the Effects of Environmental Factors on Photosynthetic Intensity."**

## Phase 2: High Efficiency Score Boosters (Easy points, ~15-20 pts)
**Goal:** Master Ecology and Biological Engineering. These are logical and rely on term precision.

### 3. Priority #3: Selective Compulsory 2 "Ecosystems" & Selective Compulsory 3 "Fermentation/Cell/Genetic Engineering"
*   **Essential Chapters:**
    *   **SC 2:** Population growth curves (S-shape/J-shape), energy flow, and material cycling in ecosystems.
    *   **SC 3:** PCR steps, monoclonal antibody production, basic procedures of genetic engineering.
*   **Core Concepts:**
    *   **Ecology:** Energy flow process (input, transfer, loss) and related calculation formulas.
    *   **Engineering:** The **"Enzymes" (Restriction Enzymes, Ligase, Taq Polymerase)** and **"Vectors"** used in each step.
*   **Requirement:** Memorize all bold-faced definitions. The final "Big Question" in Science Comprehensive often comes from here.

## Phase 3: Logic Differentiators (Understanding focused, ~15-20 pts)
**Goal:** Compulsory 2 is the key to differentiating between average and top students.

### 4. Priority #4: Compulsory 2 "Genetics and Evolution"
*   **Essential Chapters:** Chapters 1, 2, 3, and 4.
*   **Core Concepts:**
    *   **Genetic Laws:** Steps of the "Hypothetico-Deductive" method.
    *   **Meiosis:** Chromosome/DNA quantity curves, behavior of homologous chromosomes.
    *   **Molecular Basis:** Location, template, raw materials, and direction of DNA replication, transcription, and translation.
*   **Requirement:** Don't get stuck on complex calculations; focus on memorizing the **"Why."** E.g., "Why is the gene controlling trait XX located on an autosome?" (Memorize experimental derivation steps).

---

## Phase 4: Sweeping for "Hidden Points" (Trap prevention, ~10-15 pts)
**Goal:** Clear remaining basic knowledge in *Compulsory 1* to secure points in multiple-choice questions.

### 5. Priority #5: Compulsory 1 Chapters 1-4 and 6
*   **Key Focus:** Functions of various organelles (division of labor), detection colors for sugars/lipids/proteins, characteristics of cell aging and apoptosis.
*   **Requirement:** Pay close attention to textbook illustrations and marginal notes; these are common sources for "find the incorrect statement" multiple-choice questions.

## 📌 Advice
1.  **Flexible Scoring:** Save Compulsory 2 Chapter 6 (Evolution) and SC 1 Chapter 5 (Plant Auxin) for last.
2.  **Terminology Differences:** Watch for terms like "Cytokines," "Helper T Cells," and "Epigenetics." These new curriculum concepts are high-probability scoring points in the current Gaokao format.

> **Take Action!** Go copy all bold-face terms from Chapters 2, 3, and 4 of *Selective Compulsory 1* now! This is your first step to a high score.
