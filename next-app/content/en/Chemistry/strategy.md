# Chemistry Sprint Strategy: 80/20 Rule & Logical Attack

For situations where "understanding is online but problem-solving is zero-base," the core logic for achieving explosive score growth in a short time is: **completely abandon high-difficulty calculations and obscure details, leverage strong logical understanding, and attack the highest-weighted and most logical sections.**

GaoKao chemistry score distribution usually follows: Basic Multiple Choice > Industrial Process/Comprehensive Experiment (Principles section) > Elective Questions. Here is a sprint list based on the 80/20 Rule (Pareto Principle):

## Phase 1: Multiple Choice "Survival" List (~30-36 pts)
This part doesn't require massive practice, only a clear understanding of conceptual logic.

1. **NA Avogadro Constant (High ROI)**
   - **Core Logic**: Fixed traps.
   - **Focus**: State (STP vs non-STP), hydrolysis, ionization, electron transfer (e.g., $Fe$ with dilute nitric acid, $Cl_{2}$ with $NaOH$).
   - **Expectation**: As long as you understand the essence of moles and amount of substance, these are free points.

2. **Ion Coexistence & Equation Correctness**
   - **Core Logic**: Master "Redox (e.g., $Fe^{2+}$ and $NO_{3}^{-}$ cannot coexist in acidic conditions)" and "Double Hydrolysis ($Al^{3+}$ and $AlO_{2}^{-}$, $CO_{3}^{2-}$)".

3. **Periodic Law (Strongest Logic)**
   - **Core Logic**: "Position - Structure - Property" derivation.
   - **Rules**: Remember "Metality = Reducibility = Alkalinity", "Non-metality = Oxidizability = Acidity = Hydride Stability".

4. **Basic Organic Concepts**
   - **Core Logic**: Identify functional groups.
   - **Focus**: Carbon-carbon double bonds (addition/decolorization), carboxyl groups (acidity/esterification), hydroxyl groups (substitution/oxidation).

## Phase 2: Main Questions "Logical Scoring" List (~25-30 pts)
Since your understanding is good, many "qualitative analysis" points in main questions are derived from logic rather than practice experience.

### 1. Industrial Process Questions (Focus on "Operations" & "Purpose")
- **Key Points**:
    - **Adjusting pH**: Usually to precipitate certain metal ions (e.g., $Fe^{3+}$, $Al^{3+}$).
    - **Speeding up Reaction**: Crushing, raising temperature, stirring, increasing concentration.
    - **Washing Operations**: "Ice water washing" (reduce solubility loss), "Ethanol washing" (fast drying, prevent oxidation).
- **Logic**: Treat the factory as a process of "removing impurities, keeping the main body."

### 2. Chemical Reaction Principles (Focus on "Charts" & "Equilibrium")
- **Key Points**:
    - **Le Chatelier's Principle**: Temperature increase moves towards endothermic; pressure increase moves towards fewer gas molecules.
    - **Rate Judgment**: Look at the slope. Steeper slope = faster rate.
    - **Conversion Rate/Equilibrium Constant**: Understand that $K$ only depends on temperature; this is the key to solving.

### 3. Comprehensive Experiment Questions
- **Key Points**: Tightness check, back-suction prevention, oxidation prevention, acid mist emission prevention.
- **Logic**: Every apparatus exists to create a "pure" and "safe" environment for the reaction.

## Phase 3: Elective Questions (Recommended: "Structure", ~15 pts)
**Strategy**: If you have good logical understanding, Elective 3 (Structure of Matter) has better ROI.
- **Fixed Topics**: Electron configuration, electronegativity comparison, hybridization types ($sp, sp^2, sp^3$), unit cell calculations (understand Pythagorean theorem and density formula).
- **Advantage**: Structure questions have few "twists"; once you understand the spatial model, you can finish in 10 minutes.

## Fast Score Injection Strategy Table

| Section | Suggested Time | Expected Points | Core Scoring Points |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Basic Multiple Choice** | 15% | 30+ | Periodic Law, NA, Ions, Functional Groups |
| **Material Structure** | 15% | 12+ | Configuration, Hybridization, Lattice Energy, Spatial Geometry |
| **Principles (Qualitative)** | 25% | 10+ | Equilibrium shifts, Hess's Law calculations |
| **Experiment/Process** | 25% | 10+ | pH adjustment, washing purpose, connections |
| **Calculation & Obscure** | 20% | 0 | Complex titration, rare organic mechanisms |

## Operational Advice

1. **Prioritize "Hess's Law"**: These are free points. $A \rightarrow B$ enthalpy change equals $A \rightarrow C \rightarrow B$. Simple addition/subtraction gets you 2-3 points in 3 mins.
2. **Master "Functional Groups"**: Recognize those 7-8 functional groups, and the first few parts of organic inference (structure, reaction type, name) are easy points.
3. **Study "Standard Answer Templates"**: Since you're not doing many problems, look directly at real GaoKao answers from the past 3 years. Focus on the wording for "explaining reasons" and memorize fixed phrases (e.g., "Due to the presence of $XXX$, the equilibrium shifts forward...").
